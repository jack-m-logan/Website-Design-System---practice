# Build a Website Design System

A quick practice project from Codecademy to create a website design system. 

The aim is to practice display and positioning with the box model, as well as experimenting with colour schemes and typography. 

The code could probably use DRYing a bit - if anyone views and has tips for refactoring/condensing then please do let me know!
